## Predicting unplanned hospitalizations with explainable AI   

**Company:** [Pandata](https://pandata.co/)

**Problem:** Cancer centers aim to minimize unplanned hospital readmissions rates since they are associated with poor patient health outcomes, low quality of care and high costs. Existing readmissions prediction models do not work well on the cancer population. 

**Solution:** Using clinical, demographic and socio-economic data, several cancer-specific classification models were built to identify the top 74% of patients at risk of an unplanned 30-day readmission and provide personalized support, resulting in an estimate of $2.2 million cost savings per year. A dashboard was designed with visualizations of the leading factors contributing to individual patient risk score predictions to help clinical staff design targeted interventions. 

**Methods & Tools:** xgboost, lightgbm, lasso, random forest, logistic regression, SHAP, scikit-learn, mlr3, SQL, PowerBI.
